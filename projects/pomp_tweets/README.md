# Pomp Tweets

[Anthony Pompliao (aka "Pomp")](https://twitter.com/APompliano) is a Twitter user whose account frequently discusses bitcoin and blockchain. As a follower of his, I noticed that the subject matter of his tweets had shifted over time away from securitized tradional assets and more towards bitcoin. I validated this through pulling Twitter data in R, and [tweeted my observation at him](https://twitter.com/n_feifel/status/1125164722364538881) to see if his viewpoints had in fact changed. Here's his [response](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1125171264518275072).

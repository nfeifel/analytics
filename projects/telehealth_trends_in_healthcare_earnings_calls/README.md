One of our core beliefs at [Ro](https://ro.co/) is that telehealth will rise to become a dominant healthcare delivery model in the near future. It looks like largest public healthcare companies are starting to agree.

Every quarter, public companies are required to hold earnings calls where company leaders speak on their companies' performance as well as the larger business environment. The onslaught of the Covid-19 virus and the ensuing health crisis upended existing structures, and created an opportunity for new solutions and innovative approaches to rise to the forefront. Given that the business world is always forward looking, I decided to compare the earnings calls of healthcare companies in the S&P 500, a list comprising some of the largest public companies in the world, from 2020 to the prior year to see if anything noticeable stood out. My finding? A pronounced change in language that indicates a broad shift towards telehealth.
